1. Comparing sfrob and sfrobu with test data from assignment4
time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrob
real 	    0m0.002s
user	    0m0.001s
sys	    0m0.001s

time printf '*~BO *{_CIA *hXE]D *LER #@_GZY #E\\OX #^BO #FKPS #NEM\4' | ./sfrobu
real 	    0m0.002s
user 	    0m0.000s
sys  	    0m0.003s

Comparing with data from input.txt (used for previous parts)
time ./sfrob < input.txt
real 	     0m0.011s
user	     0m0.005s
sys	     0m0.004s

time ./sfrobu < input.txt
real 	      0m6.393s
user	      0m0.912s
sys	      0m6.127s

time cat input.txt | ./sfrobu
real 	      0m9.105s
user	      0m1.224s
sys	      0m9.143s

This again makes it evident that the unbufferd IO is way worse than buffered IO.
The final command which makes the program read from stdIO, highlights this even more
because the regular file no longer buffers the contents of the file for the script.
Hence bufferedIO seems to always be better than unbufferedIO.
