wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
- Downloads coreutils tar file
tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
- Unzips the tar file into current directory
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg
- Downloads signature and keyring
whatis verify
man verify
- Understand verify
--verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
Verifies certificate
Warning: "This key is not certified with a trusted signature!"
"There is no indication that the signature belongs to
the owner." This is because there is no way to verify if the public key
does belong to the individual. If this needs to be changed, you can
sign it with your private key, so that the key is now trusted to you.

mkdir assignment4
- New directory to install coreutils
cd coreutils-8.29
emacs INSTALL
- Understand how to set prefix to install in specific directory
./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/siddharj/35L/assignment4/
make
make install

3.
cd assignment4/bin
- Enter folder with executables for all the commands
- Ran the executables: ./ls -a, ./ls -A, ./ls -a -A and ./ls -A
- to reproduce the bug

4.
cd coreutils-8.29
nano patch
Paste the patch file text from the website.
patch -p1 < patchfile
- Patches issues in these files: ls.c, local.mk and a-option.sh

5.
autoreconf --force
- Running make without running this first was giving an error
- claiming that automate versions didn't match probably because
- the system version was to old
- this command forcefully remakes all the files eliminating this
- mismatch error

6. make
- Recompiles code (with bug fix)
- Runs a command called "make all-recursive" that recurses through
- all directories
- Looking for files that have been changed and recompiles those files
- CC: indicates c file --> object file
- ls.o is compiled as ls.c is changed
 cd . && /bin/sh /u/cs/ugrad/siddharj/35L/coreutils-8.29/
    build-aux/missing automake-1.13 --gnu Makefile
 cd . && /bin/sh ./config.status Makefile depfiles
config.status: creating Makefile

It improves the performance of the ls command, since it
allows for each of the flags -a and -A to precedence over
each other if they're put together in the same ls command.
For example, if ./ls -a -A is run, the -A flag overwrites
the -a flag and vice-versa.

A2.
The company will have to check all commands that involved ls
as the working of ls has changed. Moreover, the company should
check the updates in this version of coreutils and compare with
the one they're using to see if any other bash scripts may trip
up.

python randline.py /dev/null
Output:
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py",
line 277, in choice return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range "
/dev/null is an empty file, thus when randline.py attempts
to read from this file and index elements from the file, it
results in an error as there is no failsafe to ensure that
the file is not empty

A4.
python3 randline.py
Output:
File "randline.py", line 65
except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
python2 has an automatic tuple unpacking
python3 deprecated this
hence results in a different error syntax.
