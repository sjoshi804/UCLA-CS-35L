python randline.py /dev/null
Output:
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.14/lib/python2.7/random.py",
line 277, in choice return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]

/dev/null is an empty file, thus when randline.py attempts
to read from this file and index elements from the file, it
results in an error as there is no failsafe to ensure that
the file is not empty

File "randline.py", line 65
except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
python2 has an automatic tuple unpacking
python3 deprecated this
hence results in a different error syntax.
