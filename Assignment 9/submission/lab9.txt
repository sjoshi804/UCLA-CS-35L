1. Cloned GNU Diffutils from the  main Savannah repository
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

2. & 3.  Getting the log and tags file
cd into the repository folder

To get git-log.txt
git log > ../git-log.txt

To get git-tags.txt
git tag > ../git-tag.txt

4. To find a specific commmit using the phrase "maint: quote"
git log --grep="maint: quote"

Returned the following output:
commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'

    This is in response to a recent change in the GNU coding standards,
    which now suggest quoting 'like this' or "like this", instead of
    `like this' or ``like this''.

Using the aforementioned commit id, created quote-patch.txt by running
git show 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > ../quote-patch.txt

5. Checked out the v3.0 of Diffutils
git checkout v3.0

6. Used the patch command to apply quote-patch.txt to apply the command
patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt
The patch errors encountered were skipped by pressing 'Enter' as specified by the spec.


7. Running git status
git status

Returns the following output

8. Looked up the usage of the vc-diff, vc-revert, diff-got-sourec and
diff-apply-hunk commands for Emacs

9. Used Emacs to revert changes
For files that do not have a .c extension
Ran:
emacs FILENAME
C-x v u
yes
To revert to old version
Files reverted were NEWS, README, TODO, doc/diagmeet.note, ms/config.bat, ms/config.site,
po/en.po, diff.h, system.h, tests/help-version

For files with a .c extension:
emacs FILENAME
C-x v --> This opened the *vc-diff* buffer indicating the changes made
C-c C-c --> Goto hunk, that allowed me to see the changes
C-u C-c C-a --> Revert hunk - to revert hunk as all changes seen had changed the grave accents
in comments to the single quote character, and this change was reverted

Files changed were all in the src folder

10. Manually making the changes that were rejected
cd src
ls *.c.rej

To get a list of the files that had rejected changes, this shows that diff.c and diff3.c
had files that were changed.
Hence using emacs I opened the diff.c.rej and diff.c file, looked up the line number of the
change (M-g M-g) and looked for the grave  character seen in the rejected change. Upon
seeing it, I changed it to a single quote. The changes seem to have been rejected mostly
because of differing capitalization.

11. Ran git clean -f to forcefully remove the untracked files

12. Git status to confirm whether there are around 6 files that are indicated as modified

# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   src/cmp.c
#	modified:   src/diff.c
#	modified:   src/diff3.c
#	modified:   src/dir.c
#	modified:   src/sdiff.c
#	modified:   src/util.c

Ran git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt to generate the patch
wc -l ../quote-3.0-patch.txt to check whether the file is correct according to the spec
The file was 326 lines wrong that conforms to what the spec suggested.

13. Building thr resulting modified version of Diffutils:
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH

    ./bootstrap
    ./configure
    make
    make check

(commands obtained from README-hacking as suggested by spec)

Verifying the two scenarios:

diff . -
Output:
diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory
Thus verified as only '' and no ` characters

diff --help
Output:
Usage: diff [OPTION]... FILES
Compare FILES line by line.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

  -S, --starting-file=FILE        start with FILE when comparing directories
      --from-file=FILE1           compare FILE1 to all operands;
                                    FILE1 can be a directory
      --to-file=FILE2             compare all operands to FILE2;
                                    FILE2 can be a directory

      --line-format=LFMT          format all input lines with LFMT
      --LTYPE-line-format=LFMT    format LTYPE input lines with LFMT
    These format options provide fine-grained control over the output
      of diff, generalizing -D/--ifdef.
    LTYPE is 'old', 'new', or 'unchanged'.  GTYPE is LTYPE or 'changed'.
    GFMT (only) may contain:
      %<  lines from FILE1
      %>  lines from FILE2
      %=  lines common to FILE1 and FILE2
      %[-][WIDTH][.[PREC]]{doxX}LETTER  printf-style spec for LETTER
        LETTERs are as follows for new group, lower case for old group:
          F  first line number
          L  last line number
          N  number of lines = L-F+1
          E  F-1
          M  L+1
      %(A=B?T:E)  if A equals B then T else E
    LFMT (only) may contain:
      %L  contents of line
      %l  contents of line, excluding any trailing newline
      %[-][WIDTH][.[PREC]]{doxX}n  printf-style spec for input line number
    Both GFMT and LFMT may contain:
      %%  %
      %c'C'  the single character C
      %c'\OOO'  the character with octal code OOO
      C    the character C (other characters represent themselves)

  -d, --minimal            try hard to find a smaller set of changes
      --horizon-lines=NUM  keep NUM lines of the common prefix and suffix
      --speed-large-files  assume large files and many scattered small changes

      --help               display this help and exit
  -v, --version            output version information and exit

FILES are 'FILE1 FILE2' or 'DIR1 DIR2' or 'DIR FILE...' or 'FILE... DIR'.
If --from-file or --to-file is given, there are no restrictions on FILE(s).
If a FILE is '-', read standard input.
Exit status is 0 if inputs are the same, 1 if different, 2 if trouble.

This output too has no grave characters and hence it has been verified that the modified
version of diffutils is correct

14 & 15. Sanity test
mv diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch to change the name of v3.0 modified version

git clone http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=diffutils
mv diffutils diffutils-3.0

Ran:
D/diff -pru diffutils-3.0 diffutils-3.0-patch > quote-3.0-test.txt (as specified in the spec)

The files while not idential have innocuous differences
