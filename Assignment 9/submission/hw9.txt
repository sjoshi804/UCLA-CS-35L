1. Created hw9.txt using emacs

2. Checking out version 3.0 of Diffutils into a new branch named "quote"
 git checkout -b quote v3.0 

3. Applying the patch by running the patch command (this removes the ` character from output
 statements but not from the comments)

   patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt

4 & 5. Using emacs function add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) added a ChangeLog entry 
explaining the patch 

6. Commiting these changes to the new branch

   git add .
   git commit -F ChangeLog

7. Generating a formatted patchfile using "git format-patch"

   git format-patch --stdout -1 > formatted-patch.txt

8. Verifying my partner's patch

   git checkout -b partner v3.0
   git am < partnerPatch.txt

   Running commands from README-hacking to perform a sanity check

   ./bootstrap, ./configure, make, make check

9. Verifying ChangeLog entry:
   Applying my patch to v3.0 using git am < formated-patch.txt
   
   then running the aforementioned ./bootstrap, ./configure, make commands 
   
   make distdir
   
   emacs diffutils-3.0.1-e468/ChangeLog
   
   Shows the first message on the log to be mine, thus verifying the success of the ChangeLog
   creation.

10. Running command gitk on the newest merge that is not newer than 2015-01-25
    
    Downloaded XQuartx for Mac to allow for gui viewing in ssh
    
    ssh -X siddharj@lnxsrv06.seas.ucla.edu
    
    cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
