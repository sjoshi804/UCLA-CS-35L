1. Setting up the beagle bon
Using instructions from Piazza

2. Installing ssh software
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client

3. Setting up server (from TA slides)

   - Creating a user
   sudo useradd -d /home/arnav -m arnav
   sudo passwd arnav
   
   - Giving access to ssh into my beaglebone
   cd /home/arnav
   sudo mkdir .ssh
   sudo chown -R arnav .ssh
   sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Since Arnav was not able to ssh into my beaglebone, despite being able to ping it
we assumed there was an issue with the firewall protection, and hence to 
circumvent this, we used a hotspot from my phone. And repeated the client-side ssh
step after logging in to this wifi. 

4. Client Side steps (From TA slides)
   
   ssh-keygen rsa 
   ssh-copy-id -i sid@192.168.43.211 // Copying public key onto Arnav's beaglebone
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 	     // Enables ssh-agent
   ssh-add 	     	  	     // Add private key to ssh-agent
   ssh sid@192.168.43.211
  
   Doesn't ask for password, hence succesfully able to ssh without a password
   henceforth.
