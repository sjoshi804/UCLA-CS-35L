ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Early approaches - statistical learning techniques - SVMs 
      		 - trained to maxmiise correctness not how many data sets they are correct

AlexNet - nearly halved the rate 
	- more layers

Deep Neural Networks - mathematical models to accomplish tasks easy for humans hard for 
     	    	     - mimic human neural networks

How Networks Train: data points structured 
    	     	    MSE - mean squared error

AlexNEt - Stochastic Gradient DEscent with Nesterov Momentum
